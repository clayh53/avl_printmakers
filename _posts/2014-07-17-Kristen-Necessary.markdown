description: 'I search to find the elegance, the humor, and the humanity in our constructed environments. I explore the ways people structure place and how, in turn, a place can shape a people. Looking at this interdependent relationship of place and identity, with a focus on domestic space and vernacular culture, is the foundation of my artistic practice.'
