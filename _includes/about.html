                    <p>The Asheville Printmakers are an informal group of artists whose membership includes those new to printmaking as well as seasoned, experienced artists. The definition of print is deliberately loose to include a range of innovative printmaking processes from traditional to contemporary approaches.</p>

                    <p>Membersâ€™ printing methods vary from relief printing such as woodblock, linocut, letterpress and wood engraving to intaglio methods such as drypoint, etching and photogravure. Some members use alternative photographic printing processes such as platinum-palladium and gum bichromate. Others make use of monotype and variable editions in their work. One of the common threads in most everyone's work is a hands-on involvement with the mechanical process of making a print.</p>

                    <p>Members of the Asheville Printmakers are self-selected. Criteria for inclusion are an interest and motivation in printmaking with artistic intent. Currently, the Asheville Printmakers meet on the fourth Tuesday of every month at the West Asheville library to share recent work, give and receive critiques, discuss techniques and plan shows. It is an open group and interested artists are invited to attend these meetings.</p>
                    
                    <p>Monthly meetings and progressive discussions encourage us to engage in our artistic endeavors on a regular basis. Various approaches to printmaking, practices and techniques of the Asheville Printmakers, shift our perceptions and stimulate our creativity.</p>
